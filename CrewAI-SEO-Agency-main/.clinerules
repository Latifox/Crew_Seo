**Memory Bank Integration Rules:**

CRITICAL: Before ANY task or response:
1. ALWAYS check active context (`memory://active/context`):
   - Current project state and mode
   - Ongoing tasks and their status
   - Recent decisions and updates
   - Open questions and concerns

2. ALWAYS review project context (`memory://project/context`):
   - Technical stack and dependencies
   - Project guidelines and standards
   - Architecture principles
   - Development workflow

3. ALWAYS consult decision log (`memory://decisions`) for:
   - Previous architectural choices
   - Established patterns
   - Technical rationales
   - Related decisions

4. Update progress tracking:
   - Mark completed items
   - Add new tasks identified
   - Note any blockers found

**Key Guidelines:**
- NEVER proceed without checking memory bank context
- ALWAYS maintain consistent project state
- Record ALL significant technical decisions
- Track progress in real-time
- Keep context updated with EVERY change
